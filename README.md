I am a student of informatics and computer engineering education at Universitas Negeri Jakarta (UNJ). I have always wanted to learn about things related to programming and technology. I study programming and technology because I want to know how to develop an application or website that is widely used or accessed by many people, and I also want to train my critical thinking skills.
